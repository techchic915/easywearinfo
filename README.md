#🛍️ Easy Wear Wholesale Trends – Power BI Dashboard

Overview:
This project analyzes historical sales data from Easy Wear, a women’s wholesale fashion brand serving clients across the Caribbean and U.S. Using Power BI, I explored regional trends, size set performance, channel growth, and peak season dynamics to tell a clear, data-driven story of how Easy Wear operates and where it thrives.

📊 Key Features:
Page 1 – Sales Overview: Revenue trends by month, category performance, and regional breakdown

Page 2 – Regional Trends: Sales and preferences across the Bahamas, Jamaica, Miami, and more

Page 3 – Size Set & Inventory: Plus-size (1X/2X/3X) outperforms straight sizes in both sales and revenue

Page 4 – Sales Channel Analysis: LA Showroom drives highest revenue; peak season accounts for 38%+ of annual revenue

🧠 Key Insights:
Plus-size sets generated more revenue and units sold than straight sizes

The Caribbean region remains a core market, especially for maxi dresses and jumpsuits

LA Showroom’s post-launch growth signals the power of visual merchandising

April and July showed unexpected revenue spikes, likely due to early season buying cycles
